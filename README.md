# Mug-Mayhem
My final project for my game development course at UTSA.

Mug-Mayhem is an exciting 2D side-scrolling endless combat game developed using Unity. In this game, you take control of a brave coffee mug and fight against hordes of enemies to survive as long as possible. Prepare for a caffeine-fueled adventure!
